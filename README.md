## Description

A visual tic-tac-toe game, coded in Ruby, that works in the terminal.  Users can play either with another human or against the computer, but good luck playing against the latter...

## How to Play

In the this directory, from your terminal, run `ruby game.rb` for a single-player game.  If you'd like to play with a friend, run `ruby game.rb 2`.  Enjoy!

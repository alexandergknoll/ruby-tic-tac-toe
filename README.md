# Tic-Tac-Toe

##Summary

A visual tic-tac-toe game, coded in Ruby, that works in the terminal.

##Project Map

###Pseudocode

Pseudocode how the board, the rules, and the turns will work. Assume a game with two human players sharing a keyboard. Should X always go first? How will a player use the interface to select a square? How will a winner be determined? What classes are needed? Methods? Data structures?

###Code MVP

Code tic-tac-toe for 2 human players. It should be easily, visibly playable in the terminal, and it should give contextual messages for when one player has won or there's a tie. Don't forget to write tests!

###Add Features

Some possible features:

* mid-game, one of the players could also type "surrender" and end the game in a forfeit
* more colorful board and letters

###Refactor

Refactor the working game so it can be played against a computer that just picks a random square each turn.

###Improve Computer-Player Strategies

Make the computer a little smarter. They should be able to win once in a while by applying some basic strategies.

###Unstoppable Computer-Player

The ideal is a game where the computer will never lose. They'll either beat you or force you to a tie, no matter what.
